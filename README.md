##WORK EXPERIENCE

###Smartmatic Panama S.A., Senior Developer Team Lead, Oct 2012 – Present
Smartmatic has provided election technology and services to six of the eight countries pioneering in election automation.
* Made the integration of our system’s user authentication based on Java EE (without Spring Security) with an external system which manage the authentication, (like OAuth). 
* Developed a form recognition in OpenCV and Java to extract votes from scanned vote tallies which allowed more than 400 operators transcribe thousands of votes from about 80K tallies. Cutting the project costs in more than $20K.
* Elaborated, found the budget and implemented a fixed annual training plan for all team members. With a budget of $5K per year I was able to manage the training and certifications of 30 team members in front-end, backend, database, security, etc. Increasing their productivity in at least 20%.
* Created a web application in Spring Boot to manage cloud stacks using terraform scripts reducing by more than a half the time to deploy a test environment.
* Managed the installation of a private cloud using Open Stack with the already own resources maximizing its shared use saving the company more than $5K per month in cloud services.
* Managed team of 7 in developing the adaptation of our voter authentication system to the Armenian Government law and business rules. The system was used to configure more than 2K voter authentication machines and to receive and classify the biometric data from about 5M voters.
* Created and optimized the Pentaho Kettle’s template for importing the biographic and biometric data of about 5M voters from a remote PostgreSQL database to our Oracle one. The data was imported in less than one hour, due to the voter authentication machines had to be programmed and distributed in less than 5 days.
* Led team of 5 in implementing and stress testing a mission critical web service in Java EE with JMS. It had to receive, store and route 270K transmission packages from voting machines in less than one hour.
* Managed team of 12 in upgrading our Election Management System for the new voting machines including the develop of the new Ballot Designer. It was used to design and generate 1.7K different ballot faces and serialize 80M of ballots in PDF for 55M registered voters and 92K voting machines.
* Automated the installation of our Election Management System inside a Docker container and I set a before and an after in how the application is deployed. It reduced up to an 80% setup time and reduced at least 30% of people needed to do the deployment on customer’s data center.
* Led the installation and use of a continuous integration platform (Jenkins), the migration of our build system from Ant to Maven, and installation of Sonar as code review platform. It improved a lot the daily releases to QA, the automated testing and code review.
* Restructured team of 9 to be the first one in company to fully implement Scrum achieving 50% more productivity, 90% releases on time and more than 30% less defects found.

* Founded a startup to introduce people to virtual worlds, using Open Wonderland in AWS instances, packed the viewer made in Java to Windows Store and ported it to Oculus Rift. Also, I built its e-commerce website https://cyramix.com using Drupal. Skills Utilized: Java, OpenGL, C, PHP, Swing, Docker, AWS (EC2, Cloud Front, Route 53)
* Active stack overflow user with 4.1K combined reputation in answers being the top 5% in docker tag.
* Solved a bug in Wine using unit testing and my patch was accepted (which is very difficult). Skills Utilized: C Programming Language
* Shared a skeleton to bring Java applications to Windows Store using Project Centennial on Github.
* Dockerized Lime Survey made public and it is the first result in Google with more than 100K downloads.
* Spanish native, English professional level (IELTS 6, B2), French intermediate (DELF B1)
